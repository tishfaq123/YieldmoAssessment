1)	What is the difference between Typescript and Javascript? Given an option to select one for your project, which one would you prefer and why? What are the pros and cons of picking one over the other?

I am still learning about JavaScript and donâ€™t know much about TypeScript. What I do know is that using TypeScript is a object oriented programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript is used for client-side and server-side and can be used for the development of larger applications. Also, TypeScript helps identify issues during compile time. While, JavaScript is a scripting language which is used for client-side and can be used for server-side through the use of Node.js. Despite the benefits of TypeScript I would personally prefer using JavaScript. Partially because I have much to learn about TypeScript but also because of how easy it is to use. Furthermore, since JavaScript is a scripting language, it can be directly executed in the web browser.

2)	Describe a challenging project that you have had to work on? What made it challenging?

One project that was a little challenging was actually a hackathon I participated in. The hackathon spanned over four days and took place during a time many individuals had exams going on. Due to that reason some of my teammates could not participate in the hackathon and our team was cut down to two people. Due to the time constraints and lack of team members we could not implement our project. Despite that, me and my partner managed to plan out the design of our web application and document it. Even though we did not implement our web application, me and my partner succeeded in winning the sustainability track.
